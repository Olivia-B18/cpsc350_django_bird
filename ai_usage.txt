Imma be so real with you, Josh:
I don't really know how to code in django or in html
as much as I would like to. Ideally, I would know 
both syntaxes as fluently as I know Python and be able
to code off the top of my head, but we didn't go over
that very much.

So, unless it was in the PCC 18-20 chapters, I used
Claude Code to write up code for me. I have been co-
developing with AI for the last few months a lot and
have gotten really good at prompting it. Moreover,
Claude Code is just the best coding AI I have used
because the code it writes often works first try.
It might not be the most secure code, but it works
for my purposes for now.

So, I ask it questions like "how do I add a drop down menu
that sorts birds on the Birds page in alphabetical order
or most recently added" because it is much faster than
looking up documentation or sifting through forums.

More specifically, this is what I asked Claude Code
for help with:

1. Debugging

2. Adding a sort filter 
 - views.py now includes code in birds() to parse and
   select a filter order
 - birds.html now includes GET request and dropdown to
   choose a filter

3. Adding functionality to delete a bird
 - views.py now includes delete_bird() to delete a bird
 - urls.py includes the path to the delete_bird() function
 - delete_bird.html renders the confirmation page
 - edit_bird.html has a button to begin deleting a bird

4. Prevent duplicate birds for a single user
 - forms.py has a clean_text() function for BirdForm that
   throws an error when a duplicate Bird is being submitted
 - views.py functions new_bird() and edit_bird() now pass
   the user as an argument to the BirdForm

5. Statistics Page
 - views.py now includes get_statistics() to parse and select
   which statistics to display
 - get_statistics.html renders a table of statistics based
   on the selected filter from the dropdown menu
 - urls.py includes a path to get_statistics.html

6. Using django_bootstrap5 to make the database prettier
