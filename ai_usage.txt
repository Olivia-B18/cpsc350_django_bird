Things I used AI (Claude Code) for:

1. Debugging

2. Adding a sort filter 
 - views.py now includes code in birds() to parse and
   select a filter order
 - birds.html now includes GET request and dropdown to
   choose a filter

3. Adding functionality to delete a bird
 - views.py now includes delete_bird() to delete a bird
 - urls.py includes the path to the delete_bird() function
 - delete_bird.html renders the confirmation page
 - edit_bird.html has a button to begin deleting a bird

4. Prevent duplicate birds for a single user
 - forms.py has a clean_text() function for BirdForm that
   throws an error when a duplicate Bird is being submitted
 - views.py functions new_bird() and edit_bird() now pass
   the user as an argument to the BirdForm

5. Statistics Page
 - views.py now includes get_statistics() to parse and select
   which statistics to display
 - get_statistics.html renders a table of statistics based
   on the selected filter from the dropdown menu
 - urls.py includes a path to get_statistics.html
